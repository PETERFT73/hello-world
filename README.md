# hello-world
I'm on a mission to learn R so that I can build a model and/or use machine learning to improve my ROI playing daily fantasy.
I've been playing NFL and MLB DFS for over three years. I'm currently ranked 237th out of 33K+ for NFL and 391st out of 21k for MLB. I'm hoping to find some help on here as I begin to learn R and find ways to implement predictive modeling into my process. I'm also open to colaborating with someone who may have similar interest but is on the opposite end of the spectrum (Expert level knowledge in writing code and Data Science with beginner level knowledge of pro Football and Baseball)
